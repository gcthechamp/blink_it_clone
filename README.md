#BlinkIt Clone
This is simply a clone of the website blinkit.com made using HTML and CSS. BlinkIt is an online e-commerce store for buying various types of products like groceries, snacks, pet care products, medicines and so on, mostly things which we use on a day-to-day basis. This is a very powerful website which allows us to purchase essential products at the click of our fingertips, and hence, it intrigued me how the developers have created such a stylish, easy-to-use, complex and responsive UI. This is what has inspired me to create its clone since it would enable me to learn a lot and solidify my web development skills to a great extent. The clone is responsive in almost all devices.
